# Ticket API Documentation

This document specifies the API for the ticket management service, designed to be implemented on the **SupportZen backend**. The client application will interact with these endpoints to create and update support tickets for authenticated users.

## Authentication

All requests to the Ticket API must be authenticated using a Bearer token sent in the `Authorization` header.

The token is **not** a simple API key. Instead, it is a **HMAC-SHA256 hash** generated by the client to verify the user's identity without exposing sensitive information like their secret authentication token.

-   **Method**: `HMAC-SHA256`
-   **Message**: The user's `email` address.
-   **Secret Key**: The user's secret `auth_token`.
-   **Format**: The resulting hexadecimal hash string.

The client will generate this hash and send it with every request.

**Example Header:**
`Authorization: Bearer <HMAC-SHA256-hash>`

The SupportZen backend must re-calculate this hash using the `email` from the request body and the corresponding `auth_token` it has stored for that user to verify the request's authenticity. If a user does not exist, the server will create one and trust the first request.
