# Live Chat API Documentation

This document specifies the API for the stateful live chat service, designed to be implemented on the **SupportZen backend**. The client application will interact with these endpoints to provide real-time support to authenticated users.

## Authentication

All requests to the Live Chat API must be authenticated using a Bearer token sent in the `Authorization` header.

The token is **not** the user's session token. Instead, it is a **HMAC-SHA256 hash** generated by the client to verify the user's identity without exposing sensitive information like their UUID.

-   **Method**: `HMAC-SHA256`
-   **Message**: The user's `email` address.
-   **Secret Key**: The user's `uuid`.
-   **Format**: The resulting hexadecimal hash string.

The client will generate this hash and send it with every request.

**Example Header:**
`Authorization: Bearer <HMAC-SHA256-hash>`

The SupportZen backend must re-calculate this hash using the `email` from the request body and the corresponding `uuid` it has stored for that user to verify the request's authenticity.

## Endpoints

### 1. Create a New Live Chat Session

#### Request Payload

The request body should be a JSON object with a `data` field.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `email` | string | Yes | The user's email address. |
| `name` | string | No | The user's name or current plan name (e.g., "Basic Plan"). |

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <the-generated-hmac-hash>' \
  -d '{
    "data": {
        "email": "user@example.com",

    }
}'
```

#### Success Response

Upon success, the API should return a unique `chatId` for the newly created session.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Live chat session created successfully.",
  "data": {
    "chatId": "chat-session-xyz-123"
