# SupportZen Client API Documentation

This project contains two separate API documentation files:

-   [`LIVE_CHAT_API.md`](./LIVE_CHAT_API.md) - For real-time chat sessions.
-   [`TICKET_API.md`](./TICKET_API.md) - For creating and updating support tickets.

Please refer to the appropriate file for the endpoint you wish to use. Both APIs use the same HMAC-based authentication scheme for security.
