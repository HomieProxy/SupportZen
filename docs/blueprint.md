## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grey (#333333) to establish a clean, professional aesthetic. The choice of gray evokes neutrality and stability.
- Background color: Near-black (#1A1A1A) for a modern, high-contrast look that aligns with dark mode preferences.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#5DADE2) as a highlighting color for interactive elements. It is significantly brighter than the dark-scheme background to ensure high contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Using a more geometric sans-serif for headings gives it a contemporary touch while maintaining an overall digital aesthetic.
- Use a set of consistent, minimalist icons for navigation and actions.
- Implement a responsive grid layout to accommodate various screen sizes and devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience and provide feedback.
